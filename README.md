Tools of the trade
------------------
* This program uses the Narro Engine, my own RPG engine, which is licensed under the terms of the MIT license (the Expat license).  
  The Narro Engine makes use of the tmxreader module from pytmxloader, a freeware Python package written by Dr0id to load TMX maps (https://code.google.com/p/pytmxloader/).
* The characters were designed with the awesome Game Character Hub by SÃ©bastien Bini. http://www.sebissimos.com/gch/index.php?
* All the maps (the TMX files) were designed with the most powerful and practical level editor on the entire Internet: Tiled.  
  It's a free cross-platform software in active development, with many awesome features. Seriously, give it a try. http://www.mapeditor.org/
* Some sounds were produced with Bfxr. http://www.bfxr.net/
