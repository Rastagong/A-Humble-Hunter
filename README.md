A short interactive story written by @Rastagong (http://rastagong.net)  
Made with Python 3, Pygame and my own RPG engine, the Narro Engine (v0.3). Repo: https://github.com/Rastagong/narro


1\. How to play?

* Use the arrow keys to move.
* Press W to interact with the characters and the environment (Z on QWERTY keyboards).

2\. Building  the game from the sources
----------------------
1. Requirements  
   Make sure Python 3, Pygame 1.9.2 or higher and Numpy are installed.  
   As of May 26, 2013, there are only pre-releases of Pygame 1.9.2. You will find them on the Pygame website: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.  
   If you don't find them there, you may try here for Windows: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame.  
   For Linux, you'll have to look in the Mercurial repo: https://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame/downloads.  

2. Download a source release from the _Releases_ folder (coming soon).  

3. Run "python play.py" to launch the game.

4\. Tools of the trade
------------------
* This program uses the Narro Engine, my own RPG engine, which is licensed under the terms of the MIT license (the Expat license).  
  The Narro Engine makes use of the tmxreader module from pytmxloader, a freeware Python package written by Dr0id to load TMX maps (https://code.google.com/p/pytmxloader/).
* The characters were designed with the awesome Game Character Hub by SÃ©bastien Bini. http://www.sebissimos.com/gch/index.php?
* All the maps (the TMX files) were designed with the most powerful and practical level editor on the entire Internet: Tiled.  
  It's a free cross-platform software in active development, with many awesome features such as automapping. Seriously, give it a try. http://www.mapeditor.org/
* Some sounds were produced with Bfxr, a powerful tool that any child can use. http://www.bfxr.net/
